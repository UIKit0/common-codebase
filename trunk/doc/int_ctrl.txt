Disable It : 
  set bit in AIC_IDCR, disable the interrupt on the interrupt controller;
  set bit in AIC_ICCR, clear the interrupt on the interrupt controller.


Set all AIC default handler:
  set bit in AIC_IDCR, disable the interrupt on the interrupt controller;
  set AIC_SVR and AIC_SMR, save the interrupt handler routine pointer and interrupt priority; (priority:0, interrupt_source_type:edge)
  set bit in AIC_ICCR, clear the interrupt on the interrupt controller.

set exception vector:
  write 0xE51FFF20 to the vector address. -- ldr, pc, [pc, #-0xF20]
  or, (((((unsigned int) Handler) - ((unsigned int) pVector) - 0x8) >> 2) & 0x00FFFFFF)

use a spurious handler to set the AIC_SPU;
then, set AIC_DCR = 0, to disable the protecting mode, and enable AIC to control the IRQ and FIQ.

last, write any value into AIC_EOICR, to end of interrupt,
this should be write 8 times, cause the AIC have 8 hardware stack.

enable interrupt:
  set bit in AIC_IECR, to enable the interrupt.

Clear interrupt signal:
  read AIC_IVR or AIC_FVR, the interrupt signal will be self-clear.
  ege-interrupt no need to do this.
